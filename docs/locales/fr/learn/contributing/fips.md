fr + fr-translated # FIPs
fr + fr-translated An FIP, or Farcaster Improvement Proposal, is a process for building consensus around protocol changes. FIP's are
fr + fr-translated inspired by [Ethereum's EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1)
fr + fr-translated and [Python's PEPs](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/). Anyone can write an FIP to propose a change to:
fr + fr-translated 1. A process, like the protocol's release schedule
fr + fr-translated 2. A standard, like URIs for onchain assets
fr + fr-translated 3. A implementation, like adding a new protocol feature

fr + fr-translated in [FIP-0: A proposal for making proposals](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/82). A list of
fr + fr-translated finalized proposals can be found below. Proposals are made and ratified on
fr + fr-translated the [discussions board](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/categories/fip-stage-4-finalized).
