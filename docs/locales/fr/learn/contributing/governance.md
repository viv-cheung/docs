fr + fr-translated # Governance
fr + fr-translated Farcaster embraces [rough consensus and running code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus) as its governance model. Changes happen when someone makes a proposal, gets buy-in and ships running code. Depending on the change, different groups need to be convinced:
fr + fr-translated 1. **Protocol devs**, who choose to merge changes into hubs and contracts.
fr + fr-translated 2. **Hub runners**, who choose to deploy those changes to their hubs.
fr + fr-translated 3. **App devs**, who choose the hubs they read from.
fr + fr-translated 4. **Users**, who choose the apps they want to use.
fr + fr-translated Consensus emerges from people accepting new code or rejecting it. Farcaster will not have a binding voting process,
fr + fr-translated official roles or veto power for anyone. Having too much structure ossifies systems, encourages politicking and slows
fr + fr-translated progress. Rough consensus biases to action, encourages diversity of viewpoints, and maximizes decentralization, which is
fr + fr-translated essential for a long-lived protocol. Most changes happen through the [FIP](./fips.md) process.
