ja + ja-translated Using Farcaster requires an Ethereum wallet to register your account and UI to browse the network. If you are new, we recommend starting with Warpcast on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/warpcast/id1600555445) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farcaster.mobile&hl=en_US&gl=US)

ja + ja-translated There are two kinds of apps:

ja + ja-translated 1. **Wallet App** - allows signing up, adding connected apps, posting and browsing messages.
2. **Connected App** - allows posting and browsing messages only.

ja + ja-translated ## Wallet Apps

ja + ja-translated Users must install a wallet app to get started with Farcaster. They can take onchain and offchain actions like signing up, adding connected apps, posting messages and users.

ja + ja-translated A wallet app controls the Ethereum address that owns the account. It has control over the account and can take any action on your behalf, so only use a wallet app that you trust.

ja + ja-translated ### Warpcast

ja + ja-translated Warpcast is a wallet app developed by the Farcaster team. It has a web and mobile app, though signing up is only available on mobile.

ja + ja-translated - Download: [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/warpcast/id1600555445), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farcaster.mobile&hl=en_US&gl=US)

ja + ja-translated ## Connected Apps

ja + ja-translated Connected apps can only be added once a user signs up with a wallet app. They can take offchain actions on Farcaster like writing casts, following accounts and browsing.
